# Changelog

## 2026-04-20 — Route-Share Slice 7a (OG Preview Image)

### Features
- **Rich link previews**: pasting a share link into WhatsApp, iMessage, Slack, Twitter, Discord, etc. now shows a 1200×630 preview card with the route map, stats, and branding instead of a generic text card. Generated on-demand via Next.js 15's `opengraph-image.tsx` convention.
- **Image layout** (per PRD): Mapbox Static Images render on the left 60%, stats panel on the right 40% (routing mode eyebrow, distance hero, duration + safety-score tile, sharer avatar chip), 56px yellow brand footer across the bottom.
- **Branded fallback**: 404 / 410 / fetch error / missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` all render a "This route is no longer available" card at the same 1200×630 size, so a previously-scraped OG card gets visually replaced on re-scrape instead of becoming a broken-image icon.
- **Meta tags**: `generateMetadata` on `/r/[code]` populates `<title>`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:site_name`, `og:type`, and `twitter:card=summary_large_image` from the live share payload (e.g. "victor shared a 6.8 km cycling route"). Next.js auto-wires `og:image` / `twitter:image` + width/height from the `opengraph-image.tsx` convention, with a per-deploy fingerprint query param so scrapers re-fetch after re-deploys.
- **Cache headers**: `Cache-Control: public, immutable, max-age=31536000` on the image response; `revalidate=3600` on the route handler. OG scrapers cache aggressively; this balances "fresh on re-share" against "don't re-render every OG scraper hit."

### Follow-ups deferred as separate slices
- **7b** — `next-intl` EN + RO bundles, Accept-Language detection, manual toggle
- **7c** — PostHog JS snippet with `share_view` / `install_cta_click` / `app_open_intent` events + web→mobile cookie bridge

### Verified on live share
- Share code `NX0MHjeZ` renders the full card; HTML meta tags and `Content-Type: image/png` on the image endpoint both check out. Vercel `dpl_DvConagdQSiggV2Xe55tzJrSYkTR`.

## 2026-04-19 — Route-Share Slices 4, 5a, 6

### Slice 4 — Private-Profile Pending-Follow
- Invitees claiming a share from a private sharer get `user_follows.status='pending'` instead of `'accepted'`. XP + badges + saved-route all still fire (PRD: access isn't gated on follow approval).
- `user_follows.source TEXT` column tags rows created by `claim_route_share` so the Follow Requests UI can render attribution context without a join at read time.
- Mobile toast on first-time claim swaps to "Shared route added. Follow request sent." when `rewards.followPending=true`; `FollowRequestItem` gains optional `context?: string` prop rendered as italic muted subtitle.
- Migration `2026041904_route_share_claim_private_follow.sql`. Cloud Run `defpedal-api-00055-xkg`.

### Slice 5a — Saved-Route Source Variant
- Replaces the slice-1 `z.never()` stub for `source: 'saved'` with a real schema (`savedRouteId` uuid + route payload identical to planned). API validates `saved_routes.user_id` ownership and persists `route_shares.source_ref_id` for analytics.
- `past_ride` stays stubbed until a follow-up slice delivers server-side re-planning.
- Mobile: transient `lastLoadedSavedRouteId` Zustand flag auto-branches the share emit after a saved route is loaded. No new UI surface — the existing route-preview share button does the right thing. New caption: "I saved this safer X km cycling route — open it in Defensive Pedal."
- Cloud Run `defpedal-api-00056-sc2`. No DB migration (source_ref_id exists from slice 1).

### Slice 6 — Per-Share Privacy Trim Toggle
- New `ShareOptionsModal` molecule — pre-share sheet with "Hide exact start/end address (recommended)" toggle. Defaults ON per PRD, resets each open. Short-route fallback (<400m) disables the toggle with helper text.
- Core helper `trimEndpointsForShare(polyline, { hideEndpoints, trimMeters? })` wraps `trimPrivacyZone` with the 400m safeguard and returns `{ polyline, endpointsHidden, shortRouteFallback, fullLengthMeters }`.
- API request accepts optional `hideEndpoints`; omitting it preserves the DB-level default (true).
- **Web viewer privacy fix**: `ShareMap` now derives start/end markers from the trimmed polyline's first/last coord when `endpointsHidden=true` — previously pinned the real home/work addresses even while the polyline hid them.
- Cloud Run `defpedal-api-00057-twk`. No DB migration.

### Test counts after all three slices
- core: 441 → 456 (+15)
- mobile-api: 398 → 405 (+7)
- mobile: no net change (existing useShareRoute / ShareClaimProcessor suites green)

## 2026-04-19 — Route-Share Slice 3 + Follow-Up Fixes

### Features — Slice 3 (Ambassador Rewards)
- **Rewarded claim**: taking a share link now awards XP on both sides. Invitee earns +50 welcome XP once in their lifetime (action `referral_welcome`). Inviter earns +100 XP per conversion (action `referral`), capped at 5 per calendar month.
- **Ambassador badges**: 3-tier progression (`ambassador_bronze` @ 1 conversion, `ambassador_silver` @ 5, `ambassador_gold` @ 25). Evaluated inside the claim RPC using a distinct-invitee COUNT across all of the inviter's shares.
- **Mia milestone**: when the inviter is on an active Mia journey, `profiles.mia_non_cyclists_converted` increments. Auxiliary stat for the Mia Journey Tracker — not a level-up gate.
- **Push notification**: "Someone joined via your share! — +100 XP + Ambassador badge." dispatched to the sharer on first-time claim. A "first 3 referral pushes per calendar day" bypass overrides the stock 1-per-24h daily budget; subsequent same-day referral pushes fall through to the normal suppression path.
- **Mobile surfaces**: `ShareClaimProcessor` enqueues invitee badges onto the existing `BadgeUnlockOverlayManager` and renders `XpGainToast` for the +50. New `/my-shares` stub screen as the push-notification landing target.
- **DB**: migration `2026041901_route_share_ambassador_rewards.sql` (applied as `route_share_ambassador_rewards_slice3`) seeds badges + adds the Mia counter + extends `claim_route_share` RPC.
- **API**: new `lib/ambassadorRewards.ts` dispatcher. Fastify schema strips inviter-side reward fields from the claim response before replying (additionalProperties:false enforces the barrier). Cloud Run revision `defpedal-api-00054-44f`.

### Fixes
- **Email signup 500 "Database error saving new user"**: `public.handle_new_user()` is SECURITY DEFINER but had no `search_path` pinned (long-standing `function_search_path_mutable` advisor warning). GoTrue's signup transaction runs with `search_path=auth, pg_catalog`, so the trigger body's unqualified `profiles` reference threw `relation "profiles" does not exist`. Fix: migration `2026041902_fix_handle_new_user_search_path.sql` pins the function's search_path to `public, auth, pg_temp`. One-liner, no body change. Same pattern as `202604120001_set_search_path_on_security_definer.sql` which had hardened the other SECURITY DEFINER functions but missed this one.
- **Trophy Case crash on fresh claimant account**: the slice-3 seed used `display_tab='social'` for the ambassador badges, but `BadgeDisplayTab` in `packages/core/src/contracts.ts` is a strict union (`firsts | riding | consistency | impact | safety | community | explore | events`). `achievements.tsx:214` indexes into a tab-counter by `displayTab`, so `counts['social']` was undefined and `.total++` threw. Fix: migration `2026041903_ambassador_badges_use_community_tab.sql` UPDATEs the 3 rows to `category='community' + display_tab='community'`. Slice 3 migration file also corrected in the repo for fresh rebuilds.
- **Stale badges/tiers/XP after account switch**: signing out of account A and signing in with B surfaced A's values until each individual query happened to refetch. Two layers of staleness: TanStack Query keys (`['badges']`, `['tiers']`, `['mia-journey', persona]`) aren't user-scoped, and the Zustand persist whitelist caches user-scoped projections (`cachedImpact`, `cachedStreak`, `earnedMilestones`, `pendingBadgeUnlocks`, `pendingTierPromotion`, `persona`, `mia*`, `queuedMutations`, `tripServerIds`, etc.). Fix: new `store.resetUserScopedState()` action + new `UserCacheResetBridge` provider that sits inside QueryClientProvider and under AuthSessionProvider. Tracks previous user id via `useRef` and on X→null (sign-out) or X→Y (account switch) calls `queryClient.clear()` + `resetUserScopedState()` in lockstep. Skips null→X (initial sign-in) and X→X (refresh-token rotation). Device preferences (theme, locale, voice, offline map packs, bike type, routing prefs, notify toggles) are preserved across sign-outs.

## 2026-04-19 — Route-Share Vercel Production Repair

### Fixes
- **Share viewer client-side crash**: `apps/web/components/ShareMap.tsx` called `decodePolyline(geometryPolyline6, 6)` — but core's decoder takes precision as a scale divisor (default `1e6`, matching the "polyline6" = 6 decimal digits convention). Passing literal `6` divided latitudes by 6 instead of 1e6, producing values in the 7M+ range that Mapbox's `LngLat` rejects with "Invalid LngLat latitude value: must be between -90 and 90". A second bug re-inverted every coordinate: the decoder already returns `[lon, lat]` (`polyline.ts:73`), so the extra `.map(([lat, lon]) => [lon, lat])` swap was wrong. Fixed by calling `decodePolyline(geometryPolyline6)` with default precision and no swap.
- **Next.js 15 cookie mutation during SSR**: `apps/web/app/r/[code]/page.tsx` called `cookies().set('dp_share_code', ...)` during Server Component render, which Next.js 15 forbids with a runtime error. Moved the cookie write to `apps/web/middleware.ts` (matcher `/r/:code*`, SameSite=Lax, not HttpOnly so the slice-7 PostHog snippet can read it, 30-day max-age).
- **Event handler on Server Component anchor**: the "Coming to iOS" CTA had `onClick={e => e.preventDefault()}` to suppress its `href="#"`, but `ShareCtas.tsx` is a Server Component — Next.js 15 rejects DOM event handlers. Replaced with `<span role="button" aria-disabled="true">` + CSS `pointer-events: none` / `user-select: none`.
- **Zod `.datetime()` rejecting Postgres offsets**: `timestamptz` columns serialize as `+00:00` offset form (`2026-04-19T04:54:28.298107+00:00`), which strict `.datetime()` rejects. Added `{ offset: true }` to the shared `isoDateTime` schema in `packages/core/src/routeShareContract.ts` — affects createdAt/expiresAt/revokedAt on both record + publicView schemas.
- **Vercel packages/core resolution**: `.vercelignore` was stripping `packages/core` from the Vercel build sandbox; fixed with whitelist `packages/*\n!packages/core`. Transitive zod resolution still broke with `transpilePackages` alone (Vercel installs with `--workspaces=false`, so `packages/core` has no `node_modules`) — added webpack `resolve.alias` for zod pointing at `apps/web/node_modules/zod`, plus matching `paths` entry in `apps/web/tsconfig.json` so the tsc pass honors the alias too.
- **Share error boundary now surfaces error details**: `apps/web/app/r/[code]/error.tsx` renders a debug pre-block with `error.name`, `error.message`, `digest`, and `stack` so future client-side crashes don't require DevTools to diagnose.

### Follow-ups
- Placeholder Play Store URL in `apps/web/components/ShareCtas.tsx:19` still points at `com.defensivepedal.mobile` — swap for the live listing before production launch. Tracked in `TODO.md`.

## 2026-04-18 — Route-Share Slices 1 + 2 (Tracer Bullet + Claim Flow)

### Features — Slice 1 (PR #21)
- **Shared planned-route viewer**: tap Share on route preview → 8-char base62 code (~47 bits entropy) → `https://routes.defensivepedal.com/r/<code>` → Next.js SSR viewer renders Mapbox GL map with safety-colored segments, stats bar (distance/duration/mode/safety score + sharer avatar), and CTAs (Open-in-app universal link + Google Play).
- **Core contracts**: `packages/core/src/shareCodeGenerator.ts`, `shareDeepLinkBuilder.ts`, `routeShareContract.ts` — zod discriminated union on `source` with `planned` active and `saved`/`past_ride` stubbed as `z.never()` for forward-compatibility.
- **API**: `POST /v1/route-shares`, `GET /v1/route-shares/public/:code`, `DELETE /v1/route-shares/:id` with schema validation and feature-flag gating via `ENABLE_ROUTE_SHARES`.
- **DB**: migration `20260418150119_route_shares_slice1` — `route_shares` table + RLS + `get_public_route_share` RPC (SECURITY DEFINER, atomic view-count increment).

### Features — Slice 2 (PR #22)
- **Claim flow**: invitee taps link → app opens via Android App Link → deep-link parser stamps the code → `ShareClaimProcessor` drains it into `POST /v1/route-shares/:code/claim` → claim response mapped to a `RoutePreviewResponse` → user lands on route-preview screen with the shared route rendered.
- **Cold-install fallbacks**: `installReferrer.ts` (react-native-play-install-referrer) parses `share=<code>` from Play Store install referrer. `clipboardFallback.ts` reads first-launch clipboard once and discards anything that isn't a route-share URL.
- **Idempotent claims**: `claim_route_share` RPC uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` and returns `alreadyClaimed` so repeat taps don't duplicate state.
- **DB**: migration `20260418194113_route_share_claims_slice2` — `route_share_claims` table + RPC.

### HITL
- DNS + TLS + Vercel env vars green at `routes.defensivepedal.com`.
- Google Digital Asset Links verified all 3 package IDs with debug-keystore SHA-256.
- Android App Links confirmed `verified` on device via `pm get-app-links`; link-tap from SMS opens the app directly.
- iOS Universal Links still blocked on Apple Developer seat + hardware; `FILL_ME_TEAM_ID` placeholder live in published AASA.

## 2026-04-04 — Session 3: Social Features + Impact Summary Fix + Polish

### Features
- **Follow/unfollow users**: user_follows table, follow/unfollow API endpoints, optimistic UI
- **User profile page**: public profile screen with stats, recent trips, follower/following counts, follow button
- **Username in community feed**: @username shown instead of email, tappable to open profile
- **Post-ride impact summary**: Fixed to always appear — synchronous computation from store, no async dependency
- **Elevation descent display**: Navigation footer shows "Descent" when route is net-descending
- **Trip distance from GPS**: Trip cards show actual GPS trail distance, not planned route distance

### Fixes
- **Impact summary not appearing**: Root cause 1 — OnboardingGuard redirecting /feedback to signup for anonymous users. Root cause 2 — async useEffect failing silently. Fixed with synchronous useMemo from store + guard exclusion for /feedback and /navigation
- **Stats mismatch**: Dropped duplicate get_trip_stats_dashboard RPC (old 1-arg version)
- **Like/love counter reverting**: Delayed query invalidation by 3s to preserve optimistic update
- **Toast text truncated**: Removed numberOfLines limit, wider max width, rounded rectangle instead of pill

### History Section
- Added EUR saved + hazards reported to Your Impact card and Stats Dashboard summary
- Both use same formula: EUR = distance_km × 0.35

### Deployments
- Cloud Run: revisions defpedal-api-00017 through defpedal-api-00019
- Supabase: user_follows table, get_user_public_profile RPC, username column, dropped duplicate RPC

## 2026-04-03 — Session 2: Habit Engine Refinements + Multi-Stop + Username

### Features
- **Multi-stop routes**: Up to 3 intermediate waypoints with autocomplete search, yellow map markers, works with both safe/fast routing
- **Username system**: Unique usernames (case-insensitive), set after sign-up, editable in Profile, shown as `@username` in community feed
- **Sign-up enforcement**: Anonymous open counter — dismissible signup prompt at 2nd open, mandatory at 5th
- **Choose username screen**: Post-sign-up flow prompting for unique username
- **Speed indicator**: Live GPS speed (km/h) in navigation footer card with dividers between metrics

### Onboarding Improvements
- Road risk overlay on safety-score map (colored line segments from Supabase road_risk_data)
- 4-category safety score (safe/average/risky/v.risky) with correct thresholds
- Safety score inverted to 100-avgRisk (higher = safer)
- Circuit route: origin -> nearest POI -> origin (searches park/cafe/grocery/bakery, picks safest)

- Auto-skip location permission screen if already granted
- Fixed goal-selection bounce-back bug (safety-score auto-dismiss timer)
- Compact score card at bottom, map fully interactive (zoom/pan)
- Fixed onboarding guard to trigger on fresh app open

### Hazard Reporting
- Hazard markers visible on route planning map (same as navigation)
- Crosshair + "Report here" button flow (pan map to position, tap button)
- 2x3 grid hazard picker (same as navigation style)
- Tappable hazard info cards (type, confirm/deny counts)
- Hazard zone 50% smaller (SPREAD 8 -> 4)
- Alert radius reduced 30% (100m -> 70m)
- Toast: "Reported! Other cyclists will be warned."

### History Section Redesign
- Inline streak card, guardian tier, daily quiz (removed separate Impact Dashboard)
- Order: Your Impact -> Streak -> Guardian Tier -> Stats Dashboard -> Daily Quiz -> View My Trips
- EUR saved + hazards reported added to Your Impact card and Stats Dashboard

### Fixes
- Like/love counter: delayed invalidation (3s) to preserve optimistic update
- Impact summary only for rides >50m (skip zero-distance)
- Fixed end-ride crash (missing calculateTrailDistanceMeters in preview build)
- Toast visibility (positioned higher, wider, no text truncation)
- Navigation footer dividers between Speed/ETA/Dist/Climb
- Daily quiz scrollable (explanation no longer cut off)
- Safety-score card text overflow fixed (compact 4-category layout)
- Risk categories: Very safe boundary 30 -> 33

### Deployments
- Cloud Run: revisions defpedal-api-00010 through defpedal-api-00016
- Supabase: username column, risk map RPC, updated safety score RPC, guardian tier trigger, quiz questions seeded (25)
- Multiple preview APK builds for untethered testing
