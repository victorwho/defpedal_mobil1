/**
 * Pure decision function for the signup gate.
 *
 * Returns the route to redirect the user to, or `null` if the user should be
 * allowed through. The rules encoded here:
 *
 * 1. Wait for hydration + auth load before making any decision (returning
 *    null allows the current screen to stay mounted — the gate re-evaluates
 *    when hydration finishes).
 * 2. Users with a real (non-anonymous) account always pass through.
 * 3. Pages the user reached for a legit reason (onboarding itself, active
 *    navigation, post-ride feedback) are never redirected.
 * 4. **Mandatory gate** (`count >= 3`, onboarding already done) fires on every
 *    render so hardware back / nav-away can't escape it.
 * 5. **One-shot branches** (initial onboarding, `count == 2` dismissible
 *    prompt) fire once per session. `hasRedirected` turns them off once the
 *    caller records that the redirect has fired — otherwise dismissing would
 *    immediately re-redirect.
